# ShKit

Shell utilities in a single file, just source or embed ShKit.sh to use it.

Works with bourne shell, BASH, zsh

Also, this will not work with [fish-shell](https://fishshell.com/) due to it not being posix compliant, [tcsh](http://www.tcsh.org/) due to functions not existing just like csh, [csh](http://bxr.su/n/bin/csh/) due to functions not existing.
